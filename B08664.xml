            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The CASE of Walter Kennedy Eſq; and Lettice his Wife Eldeſt Siſter, and Robert Haldanby Eſq; and Katharine his Wife Youngeſt Siſter, and Coheirs of Robert Knollys Eſq; lately deceaſed.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>WIlliam Knollys</hi> Eſq; deceaſed, Father of the ſaid <hi>Robert Knollys,</hi> made five ſeveral Leaſes or Mort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gages of ſeveral parts of the Mannor of <hi>Rotherfield Greyes</hi> in the County of <hi>Oxon,</hi> for conſiderable Sums of Money borrowed of ſeveral perſons, and died.</p>
            <p>The ſaid <hi>Robert Knollys</hi> his Son and Heir, after his death to diſcharge theſe Mortgages, and other Incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brances of his Eſtate, borrowed of <hi>Richard Hoper</hi> Eſq; 5000 <hi>l.</hi> and theſe Mortgages were all aſſigned unto <hi>John Hoper</hi> his Son in truſt for him,<note place="margin">12 &amp; 13 <hi>Nov.</hi> 19 <hi>Car.</hi> II.</note> and the Inheritance of the ſaid Mannor, and all Lands thereto belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing were by Leaſe and Releaſe, and Fine thereupon, levyed, conveyed and granted unto the ſaid <hi>Richard Hoper,</hi> and one <hi>John Honghton</hi> Gent. his Truſtee for Security of the ſaid 5000 <hi>l.</hi> and to be reconveyed on payment there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of with Intereſt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Robert Knollys</hi> being in ſome Arrears of Intereſt, and having occaſion for more Money, borrowed 5500 <hi>l.</hi> of <hi>Robert Pleydall</hi> Eſq; ſince deceaſed,<note place="margin">14 &amp; 15 <hi>Dec.</hi> 25 <hi>Car.</hi> II.</note> and the five Leaſes or Mortgages were aſſigned to him, and the Inheritance conveyed by Mr. <hi>Houghton</hi> (<hi>Richard Hoper</hi> being then dead) unto <hi>John Snell</hi> Eſq; and <hi>Henry Culpepper</hi> in truſt for <hi>Robert Pleydall,</hi> by the direction of <hi>John Hoper</hi> Executor of <hi>Richard.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Robert Pleydall</hi> made his Will,<note place="margin">In <hi>Dec.</hi> 1676.</note> and <hi>Robert</hi> his Son Executor, and died.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Robert Knollys</hi> being again in Arrears of Intereſt, and having occaſion for more Money, borrows 1500 <hi>l.</hi> more of <hi>Robert</hi> the Son,<note place="margin">16 <hi>Dec.</hi> 1678.</note> and by Indenture then made declares that the aforeſaid five ſeveral Leaſes or Mortgages made to his Father, and now veſted in him as his Executor, and alſo the Inheritance granted to <hi>Snell</hi> and <hi>Culpepper</hi> in truſt as aforeſaid, ſtand and remain as a Security as well for the 1500 <hi>l.</hi> then lent, as the 5500 <hi>l.</hi> formerly lent.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Robert Knollys</hi> being ſick and weak, and conſidering the Incumbrances upon his Eſtate, by Indenture grants and conveys unto <hi>John</hi> Lord <hi>Lovelace.</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 <hi>April</hi> 1679.</note> and Sir <hi>John Borlaſe</hi> Baronet, the Equity of Redemption of his ſaid Eſtate, and directs them to ſell and pay Mr. <hi>Pleydall,</hi> and afterwards to diſpoſe of the Surplus ariſing by ſuch Sale to ſuch Uſes as he by any Deed, or by his Will ſhould direct and appoint.</p>
            <p>About three weeks after the ſaid <hi>Robert Knollys</hi> had executed this Deed, he died inteſtate, and without making any Diſpoſition by Deed,<note place="margin">April <hi>79.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>Henry Culpepper</hi> died before Mr. <hi>Knollys,</hi> and <hi>John Snell</hi> ſurvived.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Katharine Haldanby,</hi> youngeſt Siſter of <hi>Robert Knollys,</hi> being of full age, by Deed before her Marriage con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms the Deed made by her Brother to Lord <hi>Lovelace</hi> and Sir <hi>John Borlaſe,</hi> and directs them to ſell: <hi>Lettice</hi> by Letter being then at a remote diſtance does the like;<note place="margin">15 <hi>May</hi> 79.</note> but before ſhe ſealed the Deed, Married with Mr. <hi>Kennedy,</hi> who is alſo under age.</p>
            <p>And ſo neither he nor Mrs. <hi>Snell</hi> can joyn in any Legal Act either to convey or joyn in the Sale of the Eſtate for payment of the Debt to Mr. <hi>Pleydall,</hi> and other Debts of <hi>Robert Knollys,</hi> nor can he or Mrs. <hi>Snell</hi> joyn in any Act for making Leaſes to any Tenents; and if the Eſtate cannot ſpeedily be ſold to pay off the Mortgage before Mr. <hi>Kennedy</hi> and Mrs. <hi>Snell</hi> are of age, it will be in a great meaſure waſted and eaten up with Intereſt, and Mrs. <hi>Kennedy</hi> and Mrs. <hi>Haldanby</hi> be very much injured; which if ſold now, would be very conſiderably advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagious unto them, and their Fortunes very conſiderable after all their Brothers Debts paid.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>John Snell</hi> died,<note place="margin">In <hi>August</hi> 79.</note> and left <hi>Dorothy Snell</hi> his ſole Daughter and Heir a Minor of about the age of 17 years; ſo ſhe cannot reconvey until of age, upon payment of the Mortgage money.</p>
            <p>It is therefore prayed that the Inheritance of the ſaid Eſtate may be Veſted in the Lord <hi>Lovelace</hi> and Sir <hi>John Borlace,</hi> that they may be enabled to make Sale of the Eſtate to pay the Mortgage, and other Debts of the ſaid <hi>Robert Knollys,</hi> by Act of Parliament; and the rather, for that the Heir of Mrs. <hi>Snell</hi> (if ſhe dies under age) lives in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and cannot be bound by any Decree here in Chancery, or other Act.</p>
            <p>And it is alſo prayed that it may be Enacted, That the Moiety of the Surplus of the Money ariſing and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to Mrs. <hi>Kennedy</hi> may by ſuch Sale remain in the Hands of the Lord <hi>Lovelace</hi> and Sir <hi>John Borlaſe,</hi> in Truſt for Mrs. <hi>Kennedy</hi> and her Heirs, ſhe having a Child already born, and to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed of from time to time by her ſole and apart from her Husband, until ſome Settlement made by him upon her and her Iſſue by her ſaid Husband, ſave only 700 <hi>l.</hi> for the Husband for payment of his Debts.</p>
